 * Created by nadine on 5/26/16.
 * LINKEDLIST is a doubly-linked impl of List and Deque interfaces.
 *
 * Implement a Stack from scratch
 * Single linked list used to store the data. Head is the only place to insert or remove items
 *
 * Performs best with ADD/REMOVE. Slower than arraylist for SEARCH
