/**
 * Created by nadine on 9/12/17.
 * Sinking sort. Simple algo.
 * Step  through a list, comparing each pair of adjacent items & swapping them if they are in wrong order.
 * Pass-through list is repeated until no swaps are needed. At this point, the list will be sorted.
 * Time complexity:
 * - best: O(n)
 * - average: O(n^2)
 * - worst: O(n^2)
 *
